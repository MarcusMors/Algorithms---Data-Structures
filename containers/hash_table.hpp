// F(x) = x%z /// very simple example
// do something with your x or input to turn in into a position in the table.
//
// if collision, the literature says: use 2 hash tables or more. in practice, it's useless.
// another solution is: dropping the value at the closest empty box
// if you can't avoid collisions, use a pointer to a container of f(x) values

// I have a set of data
// make a dispersion function
// make a table of it / histogram
